# Encapsulation in Dart

## Overview

This README provides an overview of encapsulation in Dart, demonstrating how to create well-structured, maintainable, and secure code. Encapsulation is a key principle in object-oriented programming that bundles data and the methods that operate on that data, while restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

## Introduction

Encapsulation in Dart involves:
1. Defining classes.
2. Declaring private variables and methods using an underscore `_` prefix.
3. Providing public getter and setter methods to control access to private variables.

## Creating Classes and Objects

In Dart, a class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Below is a simple class definition:

```dart
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;
  
  Person(this.name, this.age);
}
```

## Private Variables and Methods
To restrict access to the internal state of an object, declare variables and methods as private by prefixing their names with an underscore _.

```dart
class Person {
  String _name;
  int _age;
  
  Person(this._name, this._age);
  
  void _privateMethod() {
    print('This is a private method');
  }
}
```
Attempting to access _name, _age, or _privateMethod from outside the class will result in an error.

## Getters and Setters
Getters and setters allow controlled access to private variables. A getter retrieves the value of a private variable, and a setter updates it.

```dart
class Person {
  String _name;
  int _age;
  
  Person(this._name, this._age);
  
  // Getter for _name
  String get name => _name;
  
  // Setter for _name
  set name(String newName) {
    if(newName.isNotEmpty) {
      _name = newName;
    }
  }
  
  // Getter for _age
  int get age => _age;
  
  // Setter for _age
  set age(int newAge) {
    if(newAge > 0) {
      _age = newAge;
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
Encapsulation is a vital principle in Dart, promoting modular and maintainable code by controlling access to an objectâ€™s internal state. Using private variables and methods with public getters and setters allows you to safeguard your data and ensure it is accessed and modified in a controlled manner.
